/*
 `+load` is called upon adding the class to Objective-C runtime.
 
 Q: Why not `+initialize`?
 A: It can be in `+initialize` if implements in `dispatch_once`, only `+load` is a better choice because:
	* `+load` always execute and run only once, which reduces the possibility of race conditions.
	* Code `+load` won't be interferred by subclassing or adding category.
